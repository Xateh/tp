## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to `Decoder` which performs a full assembly process involving parsing, resolution, and validation. This process is described below in greater detail.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

#### Command Assembly (User Input to Execution)

<box type="info" seamless>

See [Detailed Command Assembly Documentation](CommandAssembly.md) for a very detailed piece of documentation on the command assembly process.

</box>

Command assembly in AssetSphere is handled as shown in the following activity diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/assembly/AssemblyActivity.puml" width=1080 />

Before a command can be executed, a sequence of steps assemble the `Command` object to be called. This process, which we call **assembly**, is split into four distinct phases. Any of these phases may produce an exception, which will terminate this process.
1. Lexing - User Input: `String` → Tokenised Command: `TokenisedCommand`
2. Parsing - Tokenised Command: `TokenisedCommand` → AST: `ASTNode.Command`
3. Resolution - Imperative: `String` → Command Extractor: `CommandExtractor`
4. Validation - Bare Command: `BareCommand` → Assembled Command: `Command`

We jointly refer to:
- (1) and (2) together as **recognition**, and
- (3) and (4) together as **decoding**.

**Recognition**

This segment describes the lexer and parser. The lexer and parser are interfaced with through the `BareCommand` facade.

<puml src="diagrams/assembly/RecognitionStructure.puml" width=1080 />

This diagram shows a truncated architecture (with auxiliary classes hidden) organized into five packages:

- **Top-Level Package**: Contains the user-facing `Command` class and its nested `CommandBuilder`
- **Lexer Package**: Contains `CommandLexer`, `TokenisedCommand`, `Token`, and related types for tokenisation
- **Parser Package**: Contains `CommandParser` and exception types for syntactic analysis
    - **AST Package**: Shows all AST node types in the hierarchy (Command, Imperative, ParameterList, etc.)
        - **Visitor Package**: Contains the `AstVisitor` interface and `CommandExtractor` implementation

<puml src="diagrams/assembly/RecognitionSequence.puml" width=1080 />

This sequence diagram traces the high-level flow of execution (omitting exceptions and various internal implementation details) starting from `BareCommand.parse(String)`:

1. **Lexing Phase**: Shows how the lexer processes the string character-by-character using peek/advance/munch operations, creating tokens
2. **Parsing Phase**: Demonstrates recursive descent parsing with the parser calling various parse methods that mirror the grammar structure
3. **Extraction Phase** (not an actual distinguished phase): Illustrates the Visitor pattern in action, with the CommandExtractor traversing the AST and populating a CommandBuilder

The diagram includes notes explaining key concepts at each phase and shows both the normal flow and error handling paths. It clearly shows the three-stage transformation: String → Tokens → AST → BareCommand.

**Decoding**

This segment describes resolution and validation. The components involved are interfaced with through the `Decoder` facade.

<puml src="diagrams/assembly/DecodingStructure.puml" width=1080 />

This diagram shows a truncated architecture (with auxiliary classes hidden) with the classes responsible for resolution and validation demarcated in their own packages.

<puml src="diagrams/assembly/DecodingSequence.puml" width=1080 />

This sequence diagram traces the high-level flow of execution (omitting exceptions and various internal implementation details) starting from `Decoder.decode(BareCommand)`:
1. **Resolution Phase**: Shows how the exact command extractor (exact: no ambiguity) is identified given the imperative.
2. **Validation Phase**: Validates all parameters and options to finish assembling the final `Command`.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how new features should be implemented and how certain existing features are implemented.

This guide details the command syntax, parsing behaviour, and design considerations for developers adding new commands.

### Commands

The command framework is built on a **uniform, regular structure**. The parser handles the low-level tokenizing and structural validation (lexing, parsing `+`/`-` prefixes, distinguishing parameters from options). Your command implementation is responsible for **semantic validation** and execution.

**Command Structure**

The parser validates all commands against this high-level grammar:

`imperative parameter_list option_list`

1. **Imperative:** A single `<word>` that identifies the command (e.g., `add`).
2. **Parameter List:** A sequence of parameters that appears _immediately_ after the imperative.
3. **Option List:** A sequence of options that appears _only after_ the entire parameter list.

The parser strictly enforces this order. Any options found before the end of the parameter list will cause a parsing error.

**Designing Parameters**

Parameters are the primary, positional inputs for your command.

- **Semantics:** Parameters are **positional** (order matters), **unnamed**, and generally **required**.
- **Implementation:** Your command will receive an _ordered list_ of parameter "variants." You are responsible for validating this list.
- **Validation:** Your implementation **must** validate:
    - **Count:** Does the number of received parameters match your command's needs (e.g., `add` requires at least one)?
    - **Type:** Is a parameter meant to be an `<index>` actually a positive integer?
    - **Variant:** Does the command accept the variants it received (e.g., does `find` accept an `ADDITIVE` parameter? Probably not.)
- **Parameter Variants:** The parser distinguishes between three parameter types and passes them to your implementation as distinct variants (e.g., as different enum types or subclasses):
    - **`NORMAL`:** A standard text value (e.g., `item` or `"new item"`).
    - **`ADDITIVE`:** A text value prefixed with `+` (e.g., `+tag`). The parser provides the _intent_ (add) and the _value_ ("tag").
    - **`SUBTRACTIVE`:** A text value prefixed with `-` (e.g., `-tag`). The parser provides the _intent_ (remove) and the _value_ ("tag").
- **Overloading:** A single command `imperative` _can_ support multiple parameter signatures (e.g., `find <index>` and `find <string>`). Your implementation must inspect the received parameter list (count, types) to determine which behavior to execute.
- **Whitespace:** The lexer handles whitespace. `param1 "param two"` is tokenized as two `text` parameters: "param1" and "param two". `param1 param two` is tokenized as three `text` parameters: "param1", "param", and "two".

**Designing Options**

Options are optional, named inputs that modify command behavior.
- **Semantics:** Options are **optional**, **non-positional** (order does not matter), and **named**.
- **Implementation:** Options are provided to your command as a collection (e.g., a map) of key-value pairs or keys. You **must not** rely on the order in which they were provided by the user.
- **Default Behaviour:** Because all options are by definition optional, your command implementation **must provide a default behaviour** for every option it supports.
- **Formats:** The parser supports two formats and delivers them as such:
    1. **Name-only (Flag):** `/force`. Your code should check for the _presence_ of the "force" key.
    2. **Name-Value Pair:** `/priority:high`. Your code should retrieve the "priority" key and its associated _value_ ("high").

**Error Handling**

Error handling is a two-part responsibility:
1. **Parser Errors:** The parser/lexer handles all **syntax errors** (e.g., unbalanced quotes, invalid tokens like `/` in a parameter, options before parameters). If parsing fails, your command will _not_ be executed.
2. **Semantic Errors:** Your command implementation is responsible for all **semantic validation**. This includes:
    - Wrong number of parameters.
    - Invalid parameter _type_ (e.g., `delete "abc"` when an `<index>` was expected).
    - Invalid parameter _variant_ (e.g., `list +tag`).
    - Invalid option _value_ (e.g., `/priority:urgent` when only `low`/`medium`/`high` are allowed).
    - Unknown options (e.g., `/nonexistent`). _Note: The base framework may ignore excess/unknown options by default._

**Warnings (non-fatal recoverable input corrections)**

Some user inputs may be invalid but are recoverable without aborting command execution. In such
cases a command may choose to proceed and return a non-fatal warning to the user describing the
correction made. Warnings are represented by the `Warning` class and exposed through the
`CommandResult` API.

As an example, the `find` command ignores duplicate keywords (case-insensitive). If the user
provides duplicate keywords, the command still executes and returns matching results, but also
attaches a `Warning` listing the ignored duplicate keywords so the user understands what was
adjusted.

The `add` command also tolerates duplicate tag inputs: if the user supplies the same tag multiple
times (e.g. `add n/Alice t/friend t/friend`), the duplicates are ignored and the command succeeds.
When this happens a `Warning` of type `DUPLICATE_INPUT_IGNORED` is attached to the `CommandResult`.
The `CommandResult` appends a small "Warnings:" block to the normal feedback so the UI can show
non-fatal corrections to the user.

**Documenting Command Syntax**

When writing help text or documentation for your new command, you **must** use the following standard notation.

- **Field Definition:** `<field-name> (<type>): <description>`
    - `<field-name>`: The placeholder in the syntax (e.g., `<index>`).
    - `<type>`: The expected data type.
    - `<description>`: A human-readable explanation.
- **Data Types:**
    - `word`: A single word of text without quotes or whitespace.
    - `string`: Text that can be a single `word` or quoted text `"with spaces"`.
    - `index`: A `word` that must be a positive integer (1, 2, …).
- **Multiplicity Notation:**
    - `item`: Exactly one.
    - `item?`: Zero or one (optional).
    - `item+`: One or more (at least one required).
    - `item*`: Zero or more (optional).

**Adding New Commands**

To add a new command to the system,

1. **Create the Command class** (e.g., `DeleteCommand extends Command`)
2. **Implement a CommandExtractor** (e.g., `DeleteCommandExtractor` with static `extract()` method)
3. **Register in Bindings enum**: Add one line like `DELETE("delete", DeleteCommandExtractor::extract)`

The system automatically handles routing and dispatch.

Your extractor should accept a `BareCommand`, a facade for the output of the lexer and parser, documented in the [BareCommand API](BareCommand.md).

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

    * 3a2. User repeats steps 1-3 to add the correct tags.

  Use case ends.

**Use case: Remove tags from contacts**

**MSS**

1. User keys command to remove tags from a contact
2. System searches for contact specified by index number and removes the specified tags from the contact
3. System displays to user the tags removed from the specified contact

   Steps 1–3 are repeated until the user is satisfied with the tags remaining on their contacts.

   Use case ends

**Extensions**

* 2a. System is unable to parse or decode command.
    * 2a1. System informs user of exact error and hints at how to fix the error.
    * 2a2. User corrects and reenters the command.

  Steps 2a1-2a2 are repeated until a valid command is entered.

* 2b. System is unable to find the specified tags to remove
    * 2b1. System informs user that the tag is not found
    * 2b2. User corrects and reenters the command

  Steps 2b1-2b2 are repeated until a valid tag to be removed is entered.

* 3a. User realises he removed the tags wrongly
    * 3a1. User keys command for re-tagging the wrongly removed tags
    * 3a2. User repeats steps 1-3 to remove the correct tags
  
  Use case ends.

**Use case: Add fields to contacts**

**MSS**

1. User keys command to add fields with a corresponding value to a contact.
2. System searches for contact specified by index number and adds the specified field with the corresponding value to the contact
3. System displays to user the field and associated value added to the specified contact.

    Steps 1-3 are repeated until all desired fields have been    
added.

    Use case ends.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**:
- The system should respond within **1 second** for each command.

**Portability**:
- The product should work on all machines (**Windows, Linux, Mac**).
- The system should only require Java 17 or higher.

**Security**:
- All data must be stored **locally inside a save file**.

**Scalability**:
- The system should remain usable with up to **1000 contacts**, with command execution time not exceeding **3 seconds**.

**Usability**:
- Error messages must pinpoint exact error and suggest fixes

**Speed**:
- A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
