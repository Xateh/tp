' Lexing Phase
Cmd -> Lexer: lexCommand(commandString)
activate Lexer

note right of Lexer
  Lexer processes the string
  character by character:
  - peek() to look ahead
  - advance() to consume
  - munch() to collect patterns
end note

Lexer -> Lexer: lex()
activate Lexer

loop while not at end
    Lexer -> Lexer: scanToken()

    activate Lexer

end

Lexer -> Lexer: addToken(TERMINAL)

Lexer -> TokCmd: new TokenisedCommand(tokens)
Lexer --> Cmd: return TokenisedCommand
deactivate Lexer

' Parsing Phase
Cmd -> Parser: parseCommand(tokenisedCommand)
activate Parser

note right of Parser
  Parser uses recursive descent,
  calling parsing methods that
  mirror the grammar structure
end note

Parser -> Parser: parseCommand()
activate Parser

create AST
Parser -> AST: new Command(imperative, params, options)

Parser --> Parser: return AstNode.Command
deactivate Parser

Parser --> Cmd: return AstNode.Command
deactivate Parser

' Extraction Phase
Cmd -> Extractor: extract(astCommand)
activate Extractor

note right of Extractor
  Extractor uses the Visitor pattern
  to traverse the AST and build
  the final Command object
end note

create Builder
Extractor -> Builder: new BareCommandBuilder()

note right of Extractor
    multiple calls to
    BareCommandBuilder are made
    to set values while traversing
    the AST
end note

deactivate AST

Extractor -> Builder: build()
activate Builder

Builder -> Result: new BareCommand(imperative, params, options)
Builder --> Extractor: return BareCommand
deactivate Builder

Extractor --> Cmd: return Command
deactivate Extractor

Cmd --> System: return BareCommand
